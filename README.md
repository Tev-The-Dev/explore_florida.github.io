# explore_florida.github.io
This is a web design project from WGU class D277 - Front End Web Development to create a tourism website based on a state of my choice. The first page is the Sates' page with some introductory information about the state. The other pages are for some cities and are templated to be uniformed for more cities.

SCENARIO
Congratulations, you got the job! You just finished your first week at the state government office where you completed the orientation and onboarding documentation. You have also met with your new supervisor daily to learn more about the department and expectations of your role, as well as your new colleagues who have been teaching you about the systems used in the office. You are now ready to develop the new website for the state government office.
REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.



You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.



Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).



A.  Create 4–10 web pages of content for your website with a main page that introduces the state of your choice and additional pages for the capital and two other cities located within the state. The information for the capital and each city can vary but must include the following:

•   the city’s population

•   the year the city was incorporated

•   the region of the state in which the city is located

•   the classification of the city: urban, suburban, and/or rural

•   the average income level of the city compared to the rest of the state

1.  Include the following items on each page, using a suitable HTML element:

•   a title in the head of each document that describes the web page’s individual topic

•   a relevant image, including alternative text for the image

•   a consistent menu that allows the user to navigate to any other page on the site

2.  Include the following semantic elements from Task 1 on each page:

•   a header containing introductory content (pertaining to the document as a whole or a particular section of a document)

•   a nav to place the links to navigate throughout the site

•   a section to display the main content of the page

•   an aside to display information related to the content


B.  Include each of the following elements within your website, using suitable markup:

3.  an HTML-coded unordered list with at least three list items

4.  an HTML-coded table consisting of 3–6 columns and 3–6 rows to organize content


C.  Create an external CSS file with the following CSS rules and formatting, and apply these rules to enhance your website content:

1.  each of the following styles for text:

•   one font-family declaration

•   a :hover pseudo-class to create a rollover effect for navigation buttons

2.  a float property to position at least one HTML element to the side of another in your web page

3.  absolute and relative positioning in at least one area of your web page

4.  each of the following selectors:

•   one element selector to style the HTML elements

•   one class selector that is used at least two times to style HTML elements

•   one ID selector to format specific elements of a page


D.  Add a form on one page of your website by doing the following:


Note: The form does not need to include a functional Submit button.


•   Include text fields for the user’s first name, the user’s last name, and the user’s email address, as well as a confirmation field for the email address for verification purposes and a text box that allows the user to ask a question.

•   Ensure all fields contain placeholders.

1.  Include JavaScript code that verifies the email fields match when a user enters a second email address.
