            <h2>Main Content</h2>
            <p>Orlando Florida is one of the most popular places to visit amongst tourists, not only in the United States, but worlwide. Orlando
                is home to two of the worlds most popular theme parks, and also the biggest. Disney World, although it is not the first Disney, 
                is the biggest as it boasts over 7 different theme parks, include water parks, kid friendly parks and Disney Springs which is a
                food and shopping district just outside of the main theme park itself. Not only that, about a 20 minute drive from Disney, you will 
                find yourself at Universal Studios Orlando, which in my opinion is the better of the two now because of The Wizzarding World of Harry Potter.
                Also, there are quite a few freshwater springs that you can visit nearby, such as Kelly Springs, AKA Rock Springs, and Wekiva Springs
                if you just want to chill and float down a crystal clear river, something the entire family can enjoy for cheap. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course Orlando is home to a very vibrant art and historical scene, so if you head downtown, many of the art galleries are free or cheap,
                will have you appreciating local artists, wine and food that has come to Florida, a mixing pot of the world.

            <p>There are many things to do in and around Orlando Florida. Many people from around the world visit Florida mainly for 
                Disney or Universal, but if you branch out a bit and explore, you will find that Orlando, like many big cities, has many things to 
                do and many of them very innexpensive.
