            <p>Many people who visit Florida do not consider going to Tallahasse as it is not as busy and tourity as places like Orlando or Miami. Tallahassee offers a slower life than
                bigger cities, while holding a lot of historical and cultural things. Visiting places like the historic district or the art distric will showcase much of what the city offers, and if 
                you are feeling adventurours, less than an hour ride from the city center will bring you to Wakulla State Park, which has the worlds deepsest underwater cave and freshwater Springs
                that can be enjoyed year-round, with camping, hiking, biking and fishing for those outdoorsmen and women.
