                <p>Key West is the southernmost city in the contiguous United States and the westernmost island connected by highway in the Florida Keys. Duval Street, 
                    its main street, is 1.1 miles (1.8 km) in length in its 14-block-long crossing from the Gulf of Mexico to the Straits of Florida and the Atlantic Ocean. Key West is the southern terminus of U.S. Route 1 – the longest north–south 
                    road in the United States, as well as State Road A1A, the East Coast Greenway and, before 1935, the Florida East Coast Railway. Key West is a port of call for passenger cruise ships. The Key West International Airport provides 
                    airline service. Naval Air Station Key West is an important year-round training site for naval aviation due to the tropical weather, which is also the reason Key West was chosen as the site of President Harry S. Truman's Winter White House. 
                    The central business district is located along Duval Street and includes much of the northwestern corner of the island.

                    The island of Key West is about 4 miles (6 kilometers) long and 1 mile (2 km) wide, with a total land area of 4.2 square miles (11 km2). Within Florida, it is 130 miles (210 km) southwest of Miami by air, about 165 miles (266 km) by road.
                    Key West is approximately 95 miles (153 km) north of Cuba at their closest points, and 106 miles (171 km) north-northeast of Havana.  <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West">Wikipedia</a></cite>

                <p>Forever in vacation mode, Key West is all about kicking back. But it's not just a beach town. There's also history, culture, nature, and incredible diving and fishing. Stroll through historic Old Town to see the area's famous conch houses and where Ernest Hemingway used to live. Or take the ferry out to Dry Tortugas, a stunning, mostly underwater national park where you can snorkel with parrotfish and tour a Civil War site. Seafood and key lime pie are musts, but Cuban food is up there too (after all, Key West is just a stone's throw from Havana). Once the sun goes down (everyone watches from Mallory Square), head to Duval Street, a rowdy strip of bars and clubs, like the legendary Sloppy Joe’s. <cite><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g34345-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida-Vacations.html">Trip Advisor</a></cite>
